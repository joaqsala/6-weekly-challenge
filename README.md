# Weather Dashboard
Week 6 Challenge - Create a weather app using an API

## Description

This repository contains the files for a weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API. Using Javascript to send requests to the api, the application pulls in the day's weather for the city specified by the user. A second request to their api is then sent to receive the forcast for the next 5 days. The results of both calls dynamically populate the screen with the use of JavaScript. The users city is displayed on a clickable button for future searches and is saved to localStorage which will create the buttons on page load. The layout of the application is created through Bootstrap's framework of different rows, columns, and cards.

This webpage contains a weather app. The user can enter the name of a city and receive information about that city's weather. The temperature, humidity, wind speed, as well as a small visual icon  are all displayed to give the user a feel for the weather in that city at that exact moment in time. The app will also show the projected forcast for the next 5-days. The app saves and displays the user's city on a clickable button that can be used later for quicker weather searches without having to type their city name again.
